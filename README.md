# BruhBot - Rename coming soon

A revamp of the code for our 2019-2020 Robot, Rosetta, in the MagicBot Framework.

## Running

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or above, PIP, and pipenv installed. When you do, type ```pipenv install``` to install the dependencies, ```pipenv start``` to open a shell for that virtual environment, and ```python3 robot.py [flag]``` to run the code in whatever fashion you want.

## Why does this exist?

Since we have started using RobotPy, the Python framework for FIRST Robotics, we have admired, but never used, the MagicBot framework for our code.

This is an attempt to rewrite a previous codebase in the hopes of gaining enough experience to use it for next year's robot.

## Versioning

This project will follow a simple Semantic Versioning process. That is to say, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (Example: 0.5.2, 0.4.1, 0.4.0, etc.)

Version 1.0.0 Will mark the completion of our project, with any other commits being bug fixes or updates to libraries.
